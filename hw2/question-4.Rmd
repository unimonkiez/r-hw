1. Load the data set ’CLL’ and look at the first rows and columns to understand its structure.  
    ```{r}
    load("CLL.RData");
    colnames(CLL)[1:10]; # To understand the columns
    ```
    Not enough time to complete this question... hopefully you will enjoy the next question. 😳

2. For each of the 12625 genes, test whether its mean expression is equal for patients with stable and progressive disease and store the corresponding p-value. 

3. Compute “by hand” the adjusted p-values using Bonferroni’s correction method. 

4. How many hypotheses are rejected without correction and with Bonferroni correction? 

5. Compute the adjusted p-values using Bonferroni’s correction, Holm’s correction and BenjaminiHochberg’s correction as implemented in the function p.adjust. Compare these p-values among themselves and with the Bonferroni p-values calculated above. 

6. How many hypotheses are rejected with each of the correction methods?
