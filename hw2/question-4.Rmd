1. Load the data set ’CLL’ and look at the first rows and columns to understand its structure. 

2. For each of the 12625 genes, test whether its mean expression is equal for patients with stable and progressive disease and store the corresponding p-value. 

3. Compute “by hand” the adjusted p-values using Bonferroni’s correction method. 

4. How many hypotheses are rejected without correction and with Bonferroni correction? 

5. Compute the adjusted p-values using Bonferroni’s correction, Holm’s correction and BenjaminiHochberg’s correction as implemented in the function p.adjust. Compare these p-values among themselves and with the Bonferroni p-values calculated above. 

6. How many hypotheses are rejected with each of the correction methods?
